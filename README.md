# PBI-ZOMATO-PROJECT
The Power BI dashboard delivers an end-to-end analysis of Zomato restaurant data using interactive and business-focused visuals. Geographic maps and bar charts present restaurant distribution by country and city, helping identify high-potential markets. A dedicated calendar dashboard built using a custom Date table enables analysis of restaurant openings by year, quarter, month, and financial periods, revealing growth trends and seasonality. Rating-based visuals show the distribution of restaurants across average rating levels to assess customer satisfaction, while price bucket charts segment restaurants into reasonable cost ranges for affordability analysis. Percentage-based donut charts highlight the proportion of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery services. Cuisine- and city-level charts provide insights into popular food categories and major urban markets. Advanced Power BI features such as bookmarks are used to toggle views and improve user navigation, drill-through functionality enables detailed restaurant-level analysis from summary visuals, and slicers allow dynamic filtering across the dashboard, creating a highly interactive and user-friendly analytical experience.
